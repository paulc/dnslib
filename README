#### From Version 0.9.12 the master repository for _dnslib_ has been moved to GitHub (https://github.com/paulc/dnslib). Please update any links to the original BitBucket repository as this will no longer be maintained.

#### ~~Release 0.9.24 (2024-01-02) will be the last release supporting Python 2.7 and Python <3.7. Supporting old Python versions is increasingly painful and holds back adoption of new features so it's probably time to move on.~~

#### Given the scale of the changes (and API changes) add typing support/modernise the codebase I've decided to leave dnslib as is in maintenance mode for users who are relying on the old API (and Python2 support). I'll try to fix any minor bugs but there isnt going to be any more active development (which is more or less the status quo anyway). 


dnslib
------

A library to encode/decode DNS wire-format packets supporting both
Python 2.7 and Python 3.2+.

The library provides:

 * Support for encoding/decoding DNS packets between wire format,
   python objects, and Zone/DiG textual representation (dnslib.dns)

 * A server framework allowing the simple creation of custom DNS
   resolvers (dnslib.server) and a number of example servers
   created using this framework

 * A number of utilities for testing (dnslib.client, dnslib.proxy,
   dnslib.intercept)

Python 3 support was added in Version 0.9.0 which represented a fairly
major update to the library - the key changes include:

 * Python 2.7/3.2+ support (the last version supporting Python 2.6
   or earlier was version 0.8.3)

 * The 'Bimap' interface was changed significantly to explicitly
   split forward (value->text) lookups via __getitem__ and
   reverse (text->value) lookups via __getattr__. Applications
   using the old interface will need to be updated.

 * Hostnames are now returned with a trailing dot by default (in
   line with RFC)

 * Most object attributes are now typed in line with the record
   definitions to make it harder to generate invalid packets

 * Support for encoding/decoding resource records in 'Zone' (BIND)
   file format

 * Support for encoding/decoding packets in 'DiG' format

 * Server framework allowing (in most cases) custom resolvers to
   be created by just subclassing the DNSResolver class and
   overriding the 'resolve' method

 * A lot of fixes to error detection/handling which should make
   the library much more robust to invalid/unsupported data. The
   library should now either return a valid DNSRecord instance
   when parsing a packet or raise DNSError (tested via fuzzing)

 * Improved utilities (dnslib.client, dnslib.proxy, dnslib.intercept)

 * Improvements to encoding/decoding tests including the ability
   to generate test data automatically in test_decode.py (comparing
   outputs against DiG)

 * Ability to compare and diff DNSRecords

Classes
-------

The key DNS packet handling classes are in dnslib.dns and map to the
standard DNS packet sections:

 * DNSRecord - container for DNS packet. Contains:
    - DNSHeader
    - Question section containing zero or more DNSQuestion objects
    - Answer section containing zero or more RR objects
    - Authority section containing zero or more RR objects
    - Additional section containing zero or more RR objects
 * DNS RRs (resource records) contain an RR header and an RD object)
 * Specific RD types are implemented as subclasses of RD
 * DNS labels are represented by a DNSLabel class - in most cases
   this handles conversion to/from textual representation however
   does support arbitatry labels via a tuple of bytes objects

Usage
-----

To decode a DNS packet:

    >>> packet = binascii.unhexlify(b'd5ad818000010005000000000377777706676f6f676c6503636f6d0000010001c00c0005000100000005000803777777016cc010c02c0001000100000005000442f95b68c02c0001000100000005000442f95b63c02c0001000100000005000442f95b67c02c0001000100000005000442f95b93')
    >>> d = DNSRecord.parse(packet)
    >>> d
    <DNS Header: id=0xd5ad type=RESPONSE opcode=QUERY flags=RD,RA rcode='NOERROR' q=1 a=5 ns=0 ar=0>
    <DNS Question: 'www.google.com.' qtype=A qclass=IN>
    <DNS RR: 'www.google.com.' rtype=CNAME rclass=IN ttl=5 rdata='www.l.google.com.'>
    <DNS RR: 'www.l.google.com.' rtype=A rclass=IN ttl=5 rdata='66.249.91.104'>
    <DNS RR: 'www.l.google.com.' rtype=A rclass=IN ttl=5 rdata='66.249.91.99'>
    <DNS RR: 'www.l.google.com.' rtype=A rclass=IN ttl=5 rdata='66.249.91.103'>
    <DNS RR: 'www.l.google.com.' rtype=A rclass=IN ttl=5 rdata='66.249.91.147'>

The default text representation of the DNSRecord is in zone file format:

    >>> print(d)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 54701
    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 5, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;www.google.com.                IN      A
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    www.google.com.         5       IN      CNAME   www.l.google.com.
    www.l.google.com.       5       IN      A       66.249.91.104
    www.l.google.com.       5       IN      A       66.249.91.99
    www.l.google.com.       5       IN      A       66.249.91.103
    www.l.google.com.       5       IN      A       66.249.91.147

To create a DNS Request Packet:

    >>> d = DNSRecord.question("google.com")

(This is equivalent to: d = DNSRecord(q=DNSQuestion("google.com") )

    >>> d
    <DNS Header: id=... type=QUERY opcode=QUERY flags=RD rcode='NOERROR' q=1 a=0 ns=0 ar=0>
    <DNS Question: 'google.com.' qtype=A qclass=IN>

    >>> str(DNSRecord.parse(d.pack())) == str(d)
    True

    >>> print(d)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;google.com.                    IN      A

    >>> d = DNSRecord.question("google.com","MX")

(This is equivalent to: d = DNSRecord(q=DNSQuestion("google.com",QTYPE.MX) )

    >>> str(DNSRecord.parse(d.pack())) == str(d)
    True

    >>> print(d)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;google.com.                    IN      MX

To create a DNS Response Packet:

    >>> d = DNSRecord(DNSHeader(qr=1,aa=1,ra=1),
    ...               q=DNSQuestion("abc.com"),
    ...               a=RR("abc.com",rdata=A("1.2.3.4")))
    >>> d
    <DNS Header: id=... type=RESPONSE opcode=QUERY flags=AA,RD,RA rcode='NOERROR' q=1 a=1 ns=0 ar=0>
    <DNS Question: 'abc.com.' qtype=A qclass=IN>
    <DNS RR: 'abc.com.' rtype=A rclass=IN ttl=0 rdata='1.2.3.4'>
    >>> str(DNSRecord.parse(d.pack())) == str(d)
    True

    >>> print(d)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      A
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    abc.com.                0       IN      A       1.2.3.4

It is also possible to create RRs from a string in zone file format

    >>> RR.fromZone("abc.com IN A 1.2.3.4")
    [<DNS RR: 'abc.com.' rtype=A rclass=IN ttl=0 rdata='1.2.3.4'>]

    (Note: this produces a list of RRs which should be unpacked if being
    passed to add_answer/add_auth/add_ar etc)

    >>> q = DNSRecord.question("abc.com")
    >>> a = q.reply()
    >>> a.add_answer(*RR.fromZone("abc.com 60 A 1.2.3.4"))
    >>> print(a)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      A
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    abc.com.                60      IN      A       1.2.3.4

The zone file can contain multiple entries and supports most of the normal
format defined in RFC1035 (specifically not $INCLUDE)

    >>> z = '''
    ...         $TTL 300
    ...         $ORIGIN abc.com
    ...
    ...         @       IN      MX      10  mail.abc.com.
    ...         www     IN      A       1.2.3.4
    ...                 IN      TXT     "Some Text"
    ...         mail    IN      CNAME   www.abc.com.
    ... '''
    >>> for rr in RR.fromZone(textwrap.dedent(z)):
    ...     print(rr)
    abc.com.                300     IN      MX      10 mail.abc.com.
    www.abc.com.            300     IN      A       1.2.3.4
    www.abc.com.            300     IN      TXT     "Some Text"
    mail.abc.com.           300     IN      CNAME   www.abc.com.

To create a skeleton reply to a DNS query:

    >>> q = DNSRecord(q=DNSQuestion("abc.com",QTYPE.ANY))
    >>> a = q.reply()
    >>> a.add_answer(RR("abc.com",QTYPE.A,rdata=A("1.2.3.4"),ttl=60))
    >>> str(DNSRecord.parse(a.pack())) == str(a)
    True
    >>> print(a)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      ANY
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    abc.com.                60      IN      A       1.2.3.4

Add additional RRs:

    >>> a.add_answer(RR("xxx.abc.com",QTYPE.A,rdata=A("1.2.3.4")))
    >>> a.add_answer(RR("xxx.abc.com",QTYPE.AAAA,rdata=AAAA("1234:5678::1")))
    >>> str(DNSRecord.parse(a.pack())) == str(a)
    True
    >>> print(a)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 3, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      ANY
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    abc.com.                60      IN      A       1.2.3.4
    xxx.abc.com.            0       IN      A       1.2.3.4
    xxx.abc.com.            0       IN      AAAA    1234:5678::1


It is also possible to create a reply from a string in zone file format:

    >>> q = DNSRecord(q=DNSQuestion("abc.com",QTYPE.ANY))
    >>> a = q.replyZone("abc.com 60 IN CNAME xxx.abc.com")
    >>> print(a)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      ANY
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    abc.com.                60      IN      CNAME   xxx.abc.com.

    >>> str(DNSRecord.parse(a.pack())) == str(a)
    True

    >>> q = DNSRecord(q=DNSQuestion("abc.com",QTYPE.ANY))
    >>> a = q.replyZone(textwrap.dedent(z))
    >>> print(a)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      ANY
    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    abc.com.                300     IN      MX      10 mail.abc.com.
    www.abc.com.            300     IN      A       1.2.3.4
    www.abc.com.            300     IN      TXT     "Some Text"
    mail.abc.com.           300     IN      CNAME   www.abc.com.

To send a DNSSEC request (EDNS OPT record with DO flag & header AD flag):

    >>> q = DNSRecord(q=DNSQuestion("abc.com",QTYPE.A))
    >>> q.add_ar(EDNS0(flags="do",udp_len=4096))
    >>> q.header.ad = 1
    >>> print(q)
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: ...
    ;; flags: rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1
    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;abc.com.                       IN      A
    ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
    ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION
    ; EDNS: version: 0, flags: do; udp: 4096

Note that when using the library you should always validate the received TXID 

    q = DNSRecord.question("abc.com")
    a_pkt = q.send(address,port,tcp=args.tcp)
    a = DNSRecord.parse(a_pkt)
    if q.header.id != a.header.id:
        raise DNSError('Response transaction id does not match query transaction id')

The library also includes a simple framework for generating custom DNS
resolvers in dnslib.server (see module docs). In most cases this just
requires implementing a custom 'resolve' method which receives a question
object and returns a response.

A number of sample resolvers are provided as examples (see CLI --help):

 * dnslib.fixedresolver    - Respond to all requests with fixed response
 * dnslib.zoneresolver     - Respond from Zone file
 * dnslib.shellresolver    - Call shell script to generate response

The library includes a number of client utilities:

 * DiG like client library

        # python -m dnslib.client --help

 * DNS Proxy Server

        # python -m dnslib.proxy --help

 * Intercepting DNS Proxy Server (replace proxy responses for specified domains)

        # python -m dnslib.intercept --help

                         Note that we just fix the exception - there still seems to be a problem with parsing HTTPS records
                         (Thanks to @robinlandstrom)
 *   0.9.23  2022-10-28  Issue #43: HTTPS reads after RD end (thanks to @robinlandstrom for pull request)
                         Issue #45: Dnslib fails to handle unknown RR types in NSEC RD type bitmap
                            Bimap now supports a function to map unknown types which we use to
                            dynamically map from rtype <-> TYPExxxx for unknown record types
                            RR zone representation updated to match RFC3597
                         Pull Request #47: Add support for DS, SSHFP, and TLSA records (thanks to @rmbolger)
